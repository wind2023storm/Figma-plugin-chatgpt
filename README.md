### Overview

This plugin is experimental and takes advantage of an [unofficial ChatGPT API](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api). As such this plugin currently only operates in "Developer mode" and could break or stop working at any time. You should be reasonalby comfortable with terminal, as setup is a bit fussy.


---
### Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

1. Create an [OpenAI account](https://auth0.openai.com/u/signup/)
2. Make sure you have Node 17.0+ installed. I recommended [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) for handling Node versioning.

**Install**

1. Clone this repository into directory of your choice. `git clone https://github.com/frederickk/chatgpt-figma-plugin.git`
2. Install necessary dependencies `npm install` (you might need to run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`)
3. Get a valid session token from [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) (steps for getting the token are outlined [here](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api#session-tokens)), create a `.env` file, and paste the code into the file `SESSION_TOKEN="..."`
3. [Build](#build) then run the ChatGPT intermediate server `npm run serve`.
4. Load the plugin within Figma **Plugins > Development > Import plugin from manifest...**
5. Et voil√†!

### Usage

This plugin doesn't do anything overly complex. Simply enter a questin or request for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), click the **Send** (airplane icon) button, and (after a few seconds) the results will either:
1. spawn a new text box or
2. replace the text contents of the selected text box

Below the **Send** button, is a little console output so you can see what's going on behind the scenes.

| `npm run clean` | Cleans `./build` and any cached files |
| `npm run dev`   | Runs Webpack build process and watches for changes; rebuilding as necessary |
| `npm run dev:serve` | Same as dev but with UI being accessible via [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) |
